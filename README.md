## Global Population Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

## Introduction

This Power BI project explores global population trends across continents using a cleaned and curated dataset. The analysis focuses on various demographic indicators such as fertility rate, urban and rural population growth, life expectancy, age distribution, and density. The aim is to uncover patterns and insights that inform our understanding of population dynamics in different regions of the world.

## Background

Understanding population trends is essential for policymakers, development experts, and researchers. This project narrows in on selected years (2018 and 2024) and key demographic metrics to analyze the structure and growth of populations across six to seven continents. The data was separated and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency before visualization in Power BI.

## Tools I Used
	•	Power BI – for data modeling, transformation, and dashboard visualization
	•	Microsoft Excel – for initial data cleaning and restructuring
	•	Power Query – for unpivoting and shaping the data
	•	DAX – to create calculated measures (e.g., averages for percentage data)

## The Analysis

The dashboard is organized around the following key population indicators:
- Fertility Rate – Children per woman across continents (2024)
- Urban Population Growth – % growth in urban areas (2018)
- Rural Population Growth – % growth in rural areas (2018)
- Life Expectancy – Average life expectancy at birth for both sexes (2024)
- Youthful Urban Population – % of urban population aged 0–14 (2024)
- Aging Urban Population – % of urban population aged 60+ (2024)
- High Fertility & Youthful Population – Relationship between high fertility rates and youthful age structures
- Aging Societies – Insights into continents with high life expectancy and aging population profiles

These insights are presented using cards, clustered bar charts, line graphs, maps, and scatter plots for effective storytelling.

## What I Learned ##
	•	Discovered key patterns such as:
	•	High fertility rates correlating with youthful populations
	•	Urbanization contributing to population growth in emerging regions
	•	Aging societies having higher life expectancies and lower fertility rates

## Conclusions ##

This project provided valuable insights into global population patterns, demonstrating how visual analytics can help identify demographic trends across continents. It also highlights the challenges and opportunities in urbanization, aging, and population growth. Going forward, these findings could support research in global development, urban planning, and social policy.
